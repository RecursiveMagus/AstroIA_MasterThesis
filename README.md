<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the code repository for my Master's Thesis "Solving classical astrodynamics problems by means of Machine Learning approaches" carried out during the final semester of the MSc in Data Science at the University of Girona.

The main goal of this master’s thesis is to analize and explore the usefulness of Machine Learning and AI tools applied to two classical problems in the field of Dynamical Systems, more concretely in Celestial Mechanics and Astrodynamics, and classic atomic physics: the spacecraft attitude (i.e. orientation) control problem and the approximation of the Poincaré map in a dynamical system of a Hydrogen molecule under a microwave field.

##### 1. Attitude control problem

The attitude control problem has the main goal of finding the optimal sequence of movements (usually in the form of *torques* generated with weak impulse thrusters and/or *magnetorquers*) that allows for the correction of the angular velocity and orientation of a space artifact in order to reach a desired final attitude. In this thesis, this problem has been formulated as a reinforcement learning problem where an agent (the "brain" of the satellite) tries to learn an optimal policy (strategy) that allows it to decide which torque should be applied at each moment in order to maximize a reward function inversely proportional to the attitude error. Several experiments have been performed, using different satellite shapes and with/without environmental perturbations. The results and programs can be found in the folder ``Part1_AttitudeControl``.

##### 2. Approximation of the Poincaré map

In the field Dynamical Systems (in particular, Celestial Mechanics or Astrodynamics, Poincaré maps are a key mathematical tool that helps to study the dynamics around a specific region of the phase space, in particular, around stable periodic orbits. For example, when considering an orbital system generated by two large mass objects (such as the system created by our planet and the Moon), there are five positions in which a small object placed there would remain stationary with respect to the large objects. These positions are known as Lagrange points or Libration points, and are usually surrounded by periodic orbits that are useful for those missions that require the deployment of an stationary artifact (such as an antenna or a radiotelescope). To have a good knowledge of these regions is crucial for the design of successful space missions.

The original idea was to work with the dynamical system of the restricted three body problem, but we decided to begin our first tests with the CP problem (the study of the movement of a Hydrogen atom when subject to a microwave field). However, the poor results and inaccuracy obtained during this second part has prevented us from progressing further. Nevertheless, the programs have been included in this repository, in the folder ``Part2_Poincare``.
