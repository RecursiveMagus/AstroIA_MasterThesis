# ODE solvers

This folder contains the code of the numerical integrators used in this project, plus three examples to demonstrate their correct performance. <br>

### Files:
``ODE_solver.py`` - Contains the implementations of the Runge Kutta Fehlberg 45 and 78 methods. <br>
``circle_test.py`` - Simple example that integrates the circle equation between t = 0 and 20 * pi . <br>
``brusselator_test.py`` - Simple example that integrates the brusselator equation with B = 2.5, A = 1 for t \in [0,50) . <br>
``lorenz_test.py`` - Integrates the Lorenz Attractor equation with ro = 28, sigma = 10 and beta = 8/3 for  t \in [0,300) <br>
